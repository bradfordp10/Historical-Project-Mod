EVTNAME96175;Austro-French Withdrawal From Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96175;In the face of the 1831 revolutions in central Italy, Pope Gregory XVI had requested Austrian assistance. The Austrians intervened,  bringing an end to the United Italian Provinces by invading Romagna in the northern Papal States. However France was not happy with Austria occupying part of the Papal States and insisted they withdraw. Romagna went into revolt again, prompting a second Austrian invasion; however this time the French joined in by landing in Ancona. The two powers remained in occupation until 1838, and Austria would continue to occupy Ferrara until the revolutions of 1848.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
