EVTNAME202066;Withdrawal From The Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC202066;In the face of the revolutions in central Italy in 1831, Pope Gregory XVI and the rulers of Modena and Parma requested Austrian assistance. The Austrians intervened, restoring ducal rule in Modena and Parma and bringing an end to the United Italian Provinces by invading Romagna in the northern Papal States. However France was not happy with Austria occupying part of the Papal States and insisted they withdraw. Romagna went into revolt again, prompting a second Austrian invasion; however this time the French joined in by landing in Ancona. Now it has been several years since the rebellion, and it is time to return Romagna to the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
EVT202066OPTA;For the Pope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
